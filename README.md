# 1W-4LED-circuit
getting started
This LED lights circuit, made with Arduino code and UNO board, 1 Watt Cool White Heatsink Mounted Adafruit LED (4 lights), 
powered with sparkfun breadboard power supply stick (3.3-5V), was created to light a photographic sculpture where each light 
would come up (coded now for 5 seconds) and then switch after half second to the next, going in the loop. The LEDs are 
mounted to a structure in an angle to illuminate the sculpture from different points, creating different shadows.

I decided to get 1W LED bright lights from Adafruit to get as sharp shadow as possible and have small light source too. 

At first, I tried TIP120 transistors but they made LEDs dimmer, so changed them for N-Channel MOSFET 60V 30A.

To power supply, I got SparkFun Breadboard Power Supply Stick - 5V/3.3V with Wall Adapter Power Supply - 9VDC 650mA. 
The breadboard stick is on at 3.3V.
